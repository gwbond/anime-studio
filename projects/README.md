projects
========

Anime Studio project files that demonstrate script use or illustrate Anime Studio functionality. 

masking-tests
-------------

I created this series of four project files to better understand Anime Studio masking behavior, particularly when additive and subtractive mask layers are interleaved with masked layers. See the [masking-tests README](masking-tests/README.md) for more info.

selgin-head-turn
----------------

This project illustrates a variation on [selgin's head turn approach](http://www.lostmarble.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15846) that includes using switch layers for the mouth and jaw. See the [selgin-head-turn README](selgin-head-turn/README.md) for more info.
